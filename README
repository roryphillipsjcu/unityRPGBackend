Basic server structure, also launch order.

These two can be launched in either order
-------------------------------------------------------
Global server is used to register realms and characters
Auth server is used to authorize accounts

Realm servers are many, they register themselves with the
global server, with a name, flag and ip/socket
Allows for multiple servers, and pretty good scalibility

Instance server pooler is used in a similar way to
the global server for realms. As instances come online
they register with the instance server pooler
Instance servers set their IP/URL, active status, and
and users in the instance

Instance servers are used to allow dungeons and raids,
on startup they will register with the instance server
pooler.
